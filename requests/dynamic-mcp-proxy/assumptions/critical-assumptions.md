# Critical Assumptions to Test

## High-Risk Assumptions Requiring Investigation

### 1. Dynamic Tool Registration After Server Start
**Assumption**: We can add tools to mark3labs/mcp-go after ServeStdio() is called
**Risk**: Research suggests tools must be added before server starts
**Investigation**: Create test app to verify if AddTool works after server start

### 2. MCP Client Implementation Feasibility
**Assumption**: Can implement MCP client in Go to connect to other servers
**Risk**: No official Go MCP client library exists
**Investigation**: Test connecting to an MCP server as a client using JSON-RPC

### 3. Tool Discovery Protocol
**Assumption**: MCP servers expose a standard way to list available tools
**Risk**: Protocol may not define tool discovery mechanism
**Investigation**: Test tool discovery with a running MCP server

### 4. Concurrent Server Management
**Assumption**: Can maintain connections to multiple MCP servers concurrently
**Risk**: Resource constraints or protocol limitations
**Investigation**: Test connecting to multiple servers simultaneously

### 5. Tool Invocation Proxying
**Assumption**: Can forward tool calls transparently to remote servers
**Risk**: Request/response format may need transformation
**Investigation**: Test proxying a tool call to remote server

## Medium-Risk Assumptions

### 6. Performance Overhead
**Assumption**: Proxy adds <500ms latency to tool calls
**Risk**: Network + serialization overhead may be higher
**Investigation**: Benchmark proxy overhead with real servers

### 7. Error Propagation
**Assumption**: Can properly forward errors from remote servers
**Risk**: Error formats may need translation
**Investigation**: Test error scenarios through proxy

### 8. Authentication Handling
**Assumption**: Can pass through auth credentials to remote servers
**Risk**: Different auth mechanisms may conflict
**Investigation**: Test with authenticated MCP server

## Investigation Priority

1. **Dynamic Tool Registration** - Fundamental to entire approach
2. **MCP Client Implementation** - Required for any proxy functionality
3. **Tool Discovery** - Needed to know what tools to proxy
4. **Tool Invocation Proxying** - Core proxy functionality
5. **Concurrent Connections** - For multi-server support
