# Master Request Analysis

## Original Request
"Build a dynamic mcp server that has a tool that takes the configuration for running or connecting to an mcp server and then merges the tools from that mcp server dynamically into it's list of tools with a prefix."

## Business Context
This feature enables a "proxy" or "hub" MCP server that can dynamically discover and expose tools from other MCP servers. This is useful for:
- Aggregating tools from multiple specialized MCP servers
- Creating a unified interface for AI assistants
- Avoiding the need to configure multiple servers in Claude Desktop
- Dynamic service discovery in distributed MCP environments

## Success Definition
- User can configure a single MCP server in Claude Desktop that provides access to tools from multiple other MCP servers
- Tools from remote servers are prefixed to avoid naming conflicts
- Dynamic discovery works with both stdio and HTTP-based MCP servers
- Performance is acceptable (sub-second tool discovery)

## Project Phase
Prototype/MVP - This is a new capability that extends the basic MCP server functionality

## Timeline Constraints
No explicit deadline, but should be production-ready for use with Claude Desktop

## Integration Scope
- Current MCP server implementation (mark3labs/mcp-go)
- MCP protocol specification for tool discovery
- Both stdio and HTTP transport support
- Claude Desktop compatibility

## Critical Assumptions Identification

### Technical Assumptions
- **MCP Protocol Support**: The MCP protocol supports dynamic tool registration and discovery
- **Transport Compatibility**: Can connect to both stdio and HTTP-based MCP servers from Go
- **Tool Merging**: Can dynamically add tools to a running MCP server instance
- **Performance**: Tool discovery and proxying adds <500ms latency
- **Memory**: Proxying multiple servers won't exceed reasonable memory limits

### Business Assumptions
- **Use Case**: Users want to aggregate multiple MCP servers into one interface
- **Naming Conflicts**: Prefixing tools is an acceptable solution for conflicts
- **Configuration**: JSON/YAML configuration is acceptable for defining remote servers
- **Authentication**: Remote servers may require authentication tokens

### Architecture Assumptions
- **mark3labs/mcp-go**: The library supports dynamic tool registration
- **Concurrent Connections**: Can maintain connections to multiple MCP servers
- **Error Handling**: Can gracefully handle remote server failures
- **Hot Reload**: Can add/remove remote servers without restart

### Resource Assumptions
- **Development Time**: 16-24 hours for full implementation
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of MCP protocol internals
- **Testing**: Can test with multiple MCP server instances

### Integration Assumptions
- **Claude Desktop**: Works seamlessly with Claude Desktop's MCP client
- **Protocol Version**: Compatible with current MCP protocol version
- **Tool Schemas**: Can properly forward tool schemas and parameters

## Assumption Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Assumptions
- **Dynamic Tool Registration**: mark3labs/mcp-go may not support adding tools after server start - could require library modifications
- **Protocol Proxying**: MCP protocol may have session-specific state that's hard to proxy
- **Transport Abstraction**: Connecting to other MCP servers as a client while being a server may be complex

### Medium-Risk Assumptions
- **Performance**: Tool invocation through proxy layer may add significant latency
- **Error Propagation**: Properly forwarding errors from remote servers may be complex
- **Authentication**: Handling auth for multiple remote servers securely

### Low-Risk Assumptions
- **Configuration Format**: Easy to change if JSON/YAML isn't ideal
- **Naming Prefixes**: Simple string manipulation
- **Basic Connectivity**: Go has good HTTP/stdio support
