# Dynamic MCP Proxy Server - Planning Summary

## Feature Overview
Building a dynamic MCP server that acts as a proxy/hub, connecting to multiple remote MCP servers and exposing their tools with prefixes to avoid naming conflicts.

## Architecture Pattern
**Pre-Discovery Proxy Pattern**: Due to mark3labs/mcp-go limitation that tools must be registered before server starts, we'll:
1. Load configuration
2. Connect to all remote servers
3. Discover all tools
4. Register prefixed tools
5. Start proxy server

## Critical Technical Decisions
1. **Static Registration**: Tools registered at startup only (library limitation)
2. **Custom MCP Client**: Must implement our own Go MCP client
3. **YAML Configuration**: For defining remote servers
4. **Prefix Strategy**: `<server_prefix>_<tool_name>` naming

## Task Breakdown

### Foundation Tasks (Sequential)
1. **Investigation Apps** - Test critical assumptions
2. **MCP Client Core** - JSON-RPC client implementation
3. **Configuration System** - YAML config with validation

### Development Tasks (Some Parallel)
4. **Tool Discovery** - Protocol implementation for listing tools
5. **Proxy Handlers** - Request/response forwarding
6. **Multi-Server Manager** - Connection pool and health checks
7. **Integration** - Wire everything together

### Quality Tasks
8. **Testing Suite** - Unit and integration tests
9. **Documentation** - Usage and configuration guides

## Risk Mitigation
- Cannot add servers dynamically → Document restart requirement
- No Go MCP client exists → Build minimal implementation
- Performance overhead → Connection pooling and caching

## Estimated Timeline
- Investigation Phase: 4 hours
- Core Development: 12-16 hours  
- Testing & Documentation: 4-6 hours
- Total: ~24 hours

## Success Criteria
- Can proxy tools from multiple MCP servers
- Tools are properly prefixed
- Errors are clearly attributed to source server
- Performance overhead < 500ms
