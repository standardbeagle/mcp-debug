# Assumption Testing Phase Started
**Started**: $(date)
**Feature**: dynamic-mcp-proxy
**Mode**: Prototype-First Execution
**Phase**: Assumption Testing

## Critical Assumptions Being Tested
1. Dynamic Tool Registration After Server Start
2. MCP Client Implementation Feasibility  
3. Tool Discovery Protocol
4. Concurrent Server Management
5. Tool Invocation Proxying

## Testing Strategy
- Test highest-risk assumptions first
- Build minimal tests to validate/invalidate quickly
- Test multiple alternatives when assumptions fail
- Focus on learning, not implementation quality
- Document impact on overall plan

## Success Criteria
- All critical assumptions validated or alternatives found
- Clear understanding of implementation complexity
- Plan adjustment recommendations documented
- Validated approach ready for production implementation
