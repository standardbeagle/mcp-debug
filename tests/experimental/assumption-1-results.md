# Assumption Testing Results: Dynamic Tool Registration

## Assumption Tested
**Can add tools to mark3labs/mcp-go after ServeStdio() is called?**

## Test Results
✅ **Can add multiple tools before ServeStdio()** - This works fine
❌ **Cannot add tools after ServeStdio() starts** - Architecturally impossible

## Critical Insight Discovered
The original assumption was **PARTIALLY CORRECT** but misunderstood:
- ✅ **Pre-ServeStdio Dynamic Registration**: Can add tools after server creation, before ServeStdio()
- ❌ **Post-ServeStdio Dynamic Registration**: Cannot add tools after ServeStdio() blocks on I/O

## Architectural Reality
`ServeStdio()` is a **blocking operation** that:
1. Takes control of stdin/stdout
2. Enters request/response loop  
3. Cannot be interrupted for configuration changes
4. Server state becomes immutable during this phase

## Plan Impact: **APPROACH CHANGE REQUIRED**

### Original Plan (Invalid)
1. Start server
2. Dynamically discover remote servers
3. Add tools to running server

### **VALIDATED APPROACH** (Architecturally Sound)
1. **Pre-Discovery Phase**: Connect to all remote servers BEFORE starting
2. **Tool Discovery Phase**: Discover all tools from remote servers  
3. **Registration Phase**: Register ALL tools before ServeStdio()
4. **Server Start Phase**: Call ServeStdio() with complete tool set

## Implementation Strategy Change
- **FROM**: Dynamic server that can add tools anytime
- **TO**: Pre-discovery proxy that gathers all tools upfront

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Server Restart Pattern**: Restart server when new tools needed (complex)
2. **Multiple Server Instances**: One proxy per remote (defeats purpose)
3. **Custom Transport**: Build non-blocking transport (high complexity)

## Recommendation
✅ **Adopt Pre-Discovery Proxy Pattern** - Aligns with library architecture
- Gather all remote server tools at startup
- Register all tools before ServeStdio()
- Simple, reliable, works with existing library

## Next Critical Assumption to Test
**MCP Client Implementation** - Can we build a client to connect to remote servers for discovery?
